# Reconciliation API

EOL provides an implementation of the [Reconciliation Service API specification](https://reconciliation-api.github.io/specs/latest/) for use with taxon names. The endpoint is [https://eol.org/api/reconciliation](https://eol.org/api/reconciliation).

## Implemented Services

In addition to the primary reconciliation query functionality, there is a Suggest Service for properties (see spec). This powers the property typeahead functionality when used with the OpenRefine app.
