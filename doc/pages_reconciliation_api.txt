Service Manifest:

  "versions": ["0.2"],
  "name": "EOL Pages",
  "identifierSpace": <some URI, probably a URL>,
  "schemaSpace": <some URI that points to a page with *more* URIs, one for each exposed Page propery>,
  "types": [
    {
      id: "page",
      description: "A representation of a taxon in EOL"
    }
  ],
  "view": "https://eol.org/{{id}}", // assume a Page identifier is of the form "pages/<page_id>"
  // skip feature_view for now
  // skip preview for now
  // suggest -- circle back -- may be useful
  // extend -- as above
}
